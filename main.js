/*
	Klister.io Plugin Template

	This is a template of a plugin in Klister.io.
	Minimum files needed are a package.json and an entry script with the following functions:
		
		Init()
		- Runs once when the Klister server starts
		- Can contain a worker loop for polling external API:s or init your DB connection.
		- The class that first ran Init() is stored in the this.Controller.Plugins['your-plugin-name']
			- This way you can get data from other plugins as well.
			- Put other plugins as dependencies to you plugin, and they will be inited to.


		Run(session, command, response)
		- Allocates a unique class with Run() for every session
		- All your Inited data (Eg. MySQL, global vars, trackers...) is avaliable in this.Controller.Plugin.pluginname
		- The parameter command is a json structure following the Klister.io pattern
		- The parameter Session is a REST or WebSocket connection with a parent Device. 
			- In the Device, you can access metadata connected to the User added by Klister.io and other plugins.
			- The response.Send() function sends the answer to the user.
			- REST/HTTP needs you to call response.Send() at least once to close the current request and end lingering.
